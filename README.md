## 1. Quick Start (60 Seconds)

Use this when you just want to get a solid result quickly.

**Choose a genre and mood**

```
Rock, Dark, Aggressive
```

**Add 3–5 core style tags**

```
Distorted Electric Guitar, Male Vocal, High Energy, Dark Atmosphere
```

**Define structure in the lyrics field:**

```
[Intro]
[Verse]
[Chorus]
[Verse]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
```

**Set advanced options:**

- Weirdness: 40–60%
- Style Influence: 60–80%
- Exclude: e.g. `Acoustic, Slow Tempo` (if you want it energetic and electric)

**Generate, listen, then:**

- Adjust tags (mood, instruments, production)
- Tweak Weirdness / Style Influence
- Regenerate as needed

---

## 2. Syntax & Best Practices

This is the "rules of the road" for how to write and place tags.

### 2.1 Where Tags Go

**Lyrics field**

- Use structural and section tags in square brackets:
  - `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Solo Section]`, etc.
- You can also add mood/feel tags inside the lyrics if desired:
  - `[Chorus | High Energy | Anthemic]`

**Style / prompt field**

- Use comma-separated descriptive phrases **without brackets**:
  - `Progressive metal, 7/8 time, Distorted guitars, Male vocal, Dark, Atmospheric`

### 2.2 Brackets vs Plain Text

- Use **square brackets** `[...]` for:
  - Section markers in lyrics: `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Intro]`
  - Structural and musical tags when embedded in lyrics
- Use **plain text** (no brackets) in style/prompt for:
  - Genre, instrumentation, mood, production, and additional descriptions

### 2.3 How Many Tags?

**Style/prompt:**

- Simple songs: 3–5 core tags
- Detailed control: 8–15 tags
- Avoid going beyond ~20 tags; too many can confuse the model.

**Per section (if tagging inside lyrics):**

- Aim for 3–8 tags per section

### 2.4 Priority

Put the most important information **first**:

1. Genre
2. Dominant mood
3. Lead instrument(s)
4. Vocal style / gender (if applicable)
5. Production / atmosphere

## 6. Combining Tags

How to combine tags for professional, controllable results.

### 6.1 Layering Approach

Think in layers.

**Base layer:** Genre + main instrument + vocal type

```
Rock, Electric Guitar, Male Vocal
```

**Emotional layer:** Mood + atmosphere + energy

```
Dark, Aggressive, High Energy
```

**Technical layer:** Production + effects + arrangement

```
Raw Production, Reverb Heavy, Distortion
```

**Structural layer:** `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, etc. in the lyrics

**Example combined prompt:**

Style:
```
Alternative rock, Dark, Aggressive, High Energy, Distorted Electric Guitar, Male Vocal, Raw Production, Reverb Heavy
```

Lyrics structure:
```
[Intro]
[Verse]
[Chorus]
[Verse]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
```

### 6.2 Dynamic Progression

Change tags by section to tell a story.

Example:
- `[Intro]`: Atmospheric, Mysterious, Clean Electric Guitar
- `[Verse]`: Introspective, Gentle, Acoustic Guitar

## 9. Expanded Genre Profiles (Top 10 U.S. Genres)

This section provides detailed profiles for the top 10 most-listened music genres in the US, with in-depth tips for crafting authentic SunoAI prompts.

---

### 9.1 R&B / Hip-Hop

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** R&B and hip-hop share urban roots but differ in delivery. Hip-hop is driven by beat-focused production – drum machines or sampled breakbeats, booming 808 bass, turntable scratches, and minimal melodic instrumentation. R&B leans on smooth melodies – electric pianos, lush synth pads, bass guitar, and often a steady trap-influenced drum groove. Both genres favor polished studio production with sampling, Auto-Tune (especially in modern rap/R&B), and heavy bass emphasis.

**Structure & Vocals:** Hip-hop tracks typically have verses of rhythmic rap vocals and a repeated chorus (hook) that may be sung or a catchy refrain. R&B songs often use classic pop structure (verse–chorus–bridge) with soulful sung verses and big emotive choruses. Rap vocals are rhythmic and spoken with rhymes and flow; R&B vocals are melodic and expressive with vocal runs and harmonies.

**Mood:** R&B tends toward romantic or introspective moods, while hip-hop often carries confident, energetic, or socially conscious tones. Expect an urban, contemporary vibe with pronounced rhythm and storytelling lyrics.

#### Example Tags & Structure

**Style Tags:**
- Hip-Hop Leaning: `Hip-Hop, Trap Beat, 808 Bass, Male Rap Vocal, Aggressive, Urban Atmosphere`
- R&B Leaning: `R&B, Smooth Rhodes Piano, Female Vocals, Soulful, Slow Jam, Warm Atmosphere`

**Lyric Structure:**
```
[Intro | Beat Only]
[Verse | Rhythmic Rap]
(Verse lyrics or placeholder)
[Chorus | Sung Hook | Soulful]
(Chorus lyrics or placeholder)
[Verse | Rap Verse 2]
...
[Chorus | Hook Repeat | Harmony]
[Outro | Fade-Out]
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Contrast Verse and Chorus:** Tag verses with minimal instrumentation (`Sparse Beat, Emphasis on Drums`) and choruses with richer layers (`Layered Harmony, Full Instrumentation`) to make hooks stand out.

**Layering:** Use `[Call and Response]` for backing vocals echoing the lead. Include ad-libs with tags like `Crowd Hype` or by including "(Yeah!)" in lyrics.

**Transitions:** Use `[Build-up]` or `[Risers]` before a chorus to inject rising tension. Use `[Outro]` for a gradual fade-out.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 30–50% for mainstream; 60–70% for experimental/cloud rap |
| Style Influence | 70–90% to anchor firmly in urban style |
| Exclude | For pure rap: `Singing, Melodic Vocals`; For R&B: `Rap, Spoken Word`; Keep it urban: `Rock, Metal, Classical` |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Overloading Tags:** Mixing `Trap, Boom Bap, Lo-fi` confuses the model. Stick to one substyle.
- **Confusing Vocals:** Always indicate `Rap Vocal` or `Sung R&B Vocals` as needed.
- **Ignoring Structure:** Insert `[Verse]` and `[Chorus]` tags to avoid repetitive loops.
- **Tag Contradictions:** Don't mix `Aggressive, Dark, Trap Beat` with `Smooth, Romantic, Ballad` in the same section.

---

### 9.2 Rock

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** Rock is characterized by electric guitars, bass guitar, and acoustic drums. Distorted guitar riffs, power chords, and energetic drum grooves define the sound. Production ranges from raw and live to polished stadium rock. The guitar tone is often distorted, and a strong backbeat on drums drives the rhythm.

**Structure & Vocals:** Traditional rock uses verse–chorus structure with bridges or instrumental solos. Many rock songs feature a guitar solo after the second chorus. Vocals range from melodic singing to raspy shouts or screams, conveying passion and grit.

**Mood:** Rock spans uplifting and anthemic (arena rock), angsty and aggressive (punk, hard rock), to dark and melancholic (grunge, gothic rock). Nearly all rock maintains energy and attitude backed by guitars and drums.

#### Example Tags & Structure

**Style Tags:**
- Classic Rock: `Rock, Distorted Electric Guitar Riffs, Acoustic Drums, Male Vocals, High Energy, Anthemic`
- Indie/Alternative: `Indie Rock, Clean Electric Guitar arpeggios, Bass Guitar, Laid-back Drums, Melancholic, Atmospheric, Male Vocals (Soft)`
- Hard Rock/Metal: `Hard Rock, Heavy Distortion, Double Kick Drums, Aggressive, Screamed Vocals, Dark Atmosphere`

**Lyric Structure:**
```
[Intro | Guitar Riff]
[Verse | Steady Groove]
(Verse lyrics here)
[Chorus | Loud & Anthemic]
(Chorus lyrics)
[Verse 2 | Build-up]
...
[Chorus | Repeat Hook]
[Solo Section | Guitar Lead]
[Chorus | Finale, Full Band]
[Outro | Riff Reprise]
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Layering for Impact:** Use `[Unison]` or `Layered Guitars` in choruses for thicker sound. Add `[Powerful Vocals]` for harmonies.

**Dynamic Progression:** Mark sections with `[Building Energy]` or `[Crescendo]` for swells. Use `[Diminuendo]` or `[Bridge | Soft Break]` for intimate moments.

**Transitions:** Use `[Break]` or `[Fill]` tags. Include `[Sforzando]` for a hard hit or `Stop-time break` for momentary pauses.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 30–50% for classic rock; 60%+ for psychedelic/prog |
| Style Influence | 80–100% for faithful rock emulation |
| Exclude | `Electronic, Hip Hop, Pop` for pure rock; `Acoustic Guitar` for fully electric sound |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Vague Genre Tag:** Just "Rock" is too generic. Specify `Blues Rock with Organ` or `Pop Rock upbeat`.
- **Overcrowding Tags:** Stick to core band instruments unless you intend a big arrangement.
- **Contradictory Energy Tags:** Don't pair `[High Energy]` and `[Gentle]` in the same section.
- **Missing Structure:** Always include `[Chorus]` and `[Solo Section]` tags.

### 9.3 Pop

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** Pop music is defined by mass appeal and catchy sound. Production is typically clean and polished, incorporating acoustic and electronic elements. Common instruments include synthesizers, programmed drum beats, rhythm guitar, and bass. Modern pop uses synth pads, electronic drums, sidechain compression, and layered backing vocals.

**Structure & Vocals:** Pop songs follow hook-centric structure: clear verses, memorable chorus, pre-chorus builds, and sometimes a bridge. Vocals are front and center – strong, clear, tuneful, and emotive. Harmonies thicken choruses.

**Mood:** Pop can be upbeat (dance-pop, teen pop), emotional (pop ballads), or anything in between. It maintains radio-friendly tone with relatable lyrics and catchy earworm quality.

#### Example Tags & Structure

**Style Tags:**
- Upbeat Dance-Pop: `Pop, Upbeat, 4/4 Dance Beat, Synth Pads, Catchy Melody, Female Vocals, Energetic`
- Emotional Pop Ballad: `Pop Ballad, Tender Piano, Orchestral Strings, Slow Tempo, Powerful Female Vocal, Melancholic, Lush Reverb`
- Pop-Rock Crossover: `Pop Rock, Electric Guitar Strums, Steady Drums, Male Vocals, Anthemic Chorus, Feel-Good`

**Lyric Structure:**
```
[Intro | Hook Teaser]
[Verse 1]
(Verse lyrics)
[Pre-Chorus | Build-up]
(Pre-chorus lyrics)
[Chorus | Big Hook | Catchy]
(Chorus lyrics)
[Verse 2]
...
[Pre-Chorus | Tension]
[Chorus | Big Hook]
[Bridge | Contrast]
(Bridge lyrics)
[Chorus | Final Peak | Ad-libs]
[Outro | Hook Outro]
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Hook Emphasis:** Layer tags in chorus with `[Anthemic]` and `[Harmonies]`. Add `Hook Melody Synth Riff` for signature riffs.

**Transitions:** Use `[Risers]` before chorus drops, `[Reverse Reverb]` into quiet bridges. Try `[Key Change Up]` for final chorus lift.

**Layering:** Use `[Verse | Bass and Snaps only]` for stripped-back verses, then `[Chorus | Full Band]` for maximum impact. Include `[Sidechaining]` for pumping dance-pop effect.

**Vocal Tagging:** Use `Melismatic Vocals` for runs and embellishments, `Staccato Vocals` for clipped rhythmic delivery.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 20–40% for mainstream pop; 50% for unique twists |
| Style Influence | 70–90% for radio-ready structure |
| Exclude | `Heavy Distortion, Screaming, Extreme Metal` for pure pop; `Acoustic Guitar, Organic Drums` for electronic pop |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Tag Overload:** Streamline to core concept with 2 main instruments and 1-2 moods.
- **Ignoring Tempo:** Use `[Medium Tempo]` or `[Fast Tempo]` tags; specify BPM if needed.
- **Mismatch Between Lyrics and Tags:** Align lyric tone with style tags.
- **Repetition Issues:** Add `[Chorus | with Variation]` or `Climactic` tags to prompt change.

### 9.4 Latin

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** Latin music includes reggaeton, Latin pop, salsa, bachata, and more. It's rhythm-centric with percussion as key. Reggaeton uses the dembow rhythm with electronic drums; salsa features congas, bongos, timbales, cowbells. Common instruments include Spanish/nylon-string guitar, brass sections, accordions (regional Mexican), piano (salsa montuno), and modern synths/drum machines.

**Structure & Vocals:** Many Latin songs follow pop/urban structure with verses, choruses, and rap bridges. Tropical genres have verses and a coro (chorus) in call-and-response. Vocals can be sung or rapped, often blended. Singing styles vary from smooth and sensual to rhythmic and fiery.

**Mood:** Latin genres carry energy and warmth. Many songs are upbeat, party-ready, or romantic. The rhythm creates infectious celebration or longing.

#### Example Tags & Structure

**Style Tags:**
- Reggaeton: `Latin, Reggaeton Beat, 4/4 Dembow Rhythm, Deep 808 Bass, Male Rap Vocals, Catchy Spanish Chorus, Danceable, Club Atmosphere`

- Salsa: `Salsa, Fast Tempo, Latin Percussion (Congas, Cowbell), Brass Section, Energetic, Call-and-Response Chorus, Spanish Vocals, Festive`

**Lyric Structure:**
```
[Intro | Beat + Riff]
[Verse 1 | Rap en Español]
(Verse lyrics)
[Chorus | Melodic Hook | Spanish]
(Chorus lyrics/hook)
[Verse 2 | Rap or Guest Verse]
...
[Chorus | Hook Repeat]
[Bridge | Break (Dance)]
(Instrumental dance break)
[Chorus | Final - with Chorus Vocals & Ad-libs]
[Outro | Fades with Beat]
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Rhythmic Tagging:** Use `Syncopated`, `Latin Groove`, `Swinging Percussion`, `[Latin Feel]`, `[Swing Feel]`, or `[Shuffle Feel]`.

**Layer Traditional and Modern:** Combine `Reggaeton Beat` with `Flamenco Guitar flourish`. Use `Light Synth Pad` for contemporary touches.

**Transitions:** Use `[Break | Stop Beat]` before chorus for stop-and-hit moments. Include `[Risers]` and `[Impacts]` for build-ups.

**Call-and-Response:** Use `[Call and Response]` for backing vocals responding to lead. Add `Crowd Chant` or `[Unison Chant]` for group vocals.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 20–40% for traditional; up to 50% for urban Latin |
| Style Influence | 80–100% to enforce rhythmic patterns |
| Exclude | For pure salsa: `Electronic, Synth, English Vocals`; For reggaeton: `Acoustic Drums, Rock Elements` |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Overgeneralizing "Latin":** Specify `Reggaeton`, `Salsa`, or `Bachata` rather than just "Latin".
- **Conflicting Rhythms:** Don't tag `Bossa Nova beat, Reggaeton beat, Salsa tempo` together.
- **Language Issues:** Include `Spanish Vocals` and Spanish placeholder lyrics to encourage Spanish phonetics.
- **Instrument Balance:** Use broad `Latin Percussion` tag rather than listing every instrument.

### 9.5 Country

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** Country music is rooted in acoustic instruments and Southern U.S. traditions. Core instruments include acoustic guitar, electric guitar (clean or lightly overdriven), bass, drums, fiddle, pedal steel guitar, banjo, and mandolin. Production ranges from raw and live to modern and polished, but maintains an "organic" feel.

**Structure & Vocals:** Country songs tell stories with verses and memorable choruses, often with a pre-chorus and bridge. Vocals are clean, narrative singing with country inflection. Both male and female vocals are common.

[Chorus | Hook & Title Line]
(Chorus lyrics – big emotional payoff)
[Verse 2 | Story Continues]
...
[Pre-Chorus | Build]
[Chorus | Repeat Hook]
[Bridge | Solo or Twist]
(Bridge lyrics or fiddle solo)
[Chorus | Final with Ad-libs]
[Outro | Resolve Gently]
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Storytelling Emphasis:** Tag verses as `[Verse | Storytelling]`. Use `[Call and Response]` for backing vocal echoes. Add `[Harmonies]` for layered chorus vocals.

**Layering by Section:** Use `[Sparse Arrangement]` for verses, then add full band for choruses.

**Dynamic Control:** Use `[Crescendo]` in pre-chorus, `[Forte]` for chorus, `[Piano]` for verses. Use `[Breakdown]` for soft bridge moments.

**Transitions:** Include `Drum Fill` mentions. Add `[Vinyl Crackle]` for vintage vibe or `[Room Reverb]` for live feel.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 20–40% for mainstream; 50–60% for alt-country |
| Style Influence | 80–100% for pure country sound |
| Exclude | `Synthesizer, EDM, Hip Hop` for traditional; `Electric Guitar` for purely acoustic |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Mixing Unrelated Genres:** Exclude opposite genres for purity.
- **Twang and Accent:** Include `Twangy Vocals` or `Southern Accent` in style prompt.
- **Instrument Balance:** Check Style Influence if key instruments are missing.
- **Too Slick vs. Too Raw:** Add `Raw Production, Live Feel` for grit or `Modern Production, Polished` for radio hit.

---

### 9.6 Electronic / EDM

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** EDM covers house, techno, trance, dubstep, drum and bass, etc. It relies on synthesizers, electronic drums, and digital effects. Common elements include synth pads, synth leads, bass synths, and percussion (four-on-the-floor kick, claps, hi-hats). Production emphasizes sidechain compression, filter sweeps, risers, and drop impacts.

**Structure:** EDM structure is often DJ-friendly: intro, build-up, drop (climax), breakdown, second build, second drop, outro. The build-up creates rising tension with snare rolls and risers; the drop is where beat and bass kick in strongly.

**Mood:** EDM varies from euphoric (trance, progressive house) to intense (dubstep, electro house) to chill (ambient, deep house). It maintains steady drive and captivating rhythm.

#### Example Tags & Structure

**Style Tags:**
- Festival EDM (Big Room): `EDM, 128 BPM, Four-on-the-floor Kick, Huge Synth Lead, Anthemic, Build-up and Drop, High Energy, Club Reverb`
- Trance: `Trance, 140 BPM, Soaring Pad Synths, 4/4 beat, Arpeggiated Melody, Uplifting, Female Vocal Chops, Euphoric Atmosphere`
- Dubstep: `Dubstep, 70/140 BPM, Half-Time Groove, Wobble Bass, Heavy, Aggressive, Synth Stabs, Male Shouts (sampled), Dark`

**Lyric Structure:**
```
[Intro | Beat Intro]
[Build-up | Rising Tension]
[Drop | Full Beat Drops]
(drop section with main riff)
[Breakdown | No Beat Pad Melody]
(atmospheric break)
[Build-up 2 | Build to climax]
[Drop 2 | Peak Energy]
[Outro | DJ-friendly outro beat]
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Rhythm and Tempo:** Specify BPM (128 BPM, 140 BPM). Use `[Four-on-the-floor]` for house/trance, `Breakbeat` for drum & bass.

**Layering for Drops:** Use `Layered Synth Leads, Thick Bass` for drops. Include `[Sidechaining]` for pumping effect. Mark breakdown with `[Minimalist]`, drop with `[Maximalist]`.

**Transitions and FX:** Use `[Risers]` in build-ups, `[Impacts]` at drops, `[Reverse Reverb]`, `[Ping Pong Delay]`. Include `[Filter Sweep]` for transitions.

**Vocal Chops:** Mention `Vocal Chops` or `Vocal Samples` in style or section tags.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 40–60% for mainstage; 70–80% for experimental (glitch, IDM) |
| Style Influence | 80–90% for specific subgenre; 60% for defined tags like `Dubstep, Wobble Bass` |
| Exclude | `Acoustic Drums, Guitar, Piano, Organic` for pure electronic; `Vocals` for instrumental |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Undefined Structure:** Define build/drop structure to avoid repetitive loops.
- **Cluttered Spectrum:** Reduce overlapping tags; simplify to key elements.
- **Rhythm Not as Expected:** Ensure Style Influence is high enough to enforce beat pattern.
- **Melody vs. Repetition:** Add `Evolving Melody` for variation or `Repetitive Hook` for consistency.

---

### 9.7 World Music

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** World music covers traditional folk and ethnic music from various cultures. Instrumentation depends on culture: African (djembe, kalimba, kora), Indian (sitar, tabla, bansuri), East Asian (erhu, guzheng, koto, shakuhachi), Middle Eastern (oud, doumbek, qanun). Production varies from purely acoustic to electronic fusions.

**Structure:** Traditional pieces might not follow Western verse-chorus structure – they could be cyclic, call-and-response, or through-composed. For SunoAI, imposing some structure helps.

**Mood:** World music can be spiritual and transcendent, festive and celebratory, or haunting and meditative. Production often incorporates natural reverb.

#### Example Tags & Structure

**Style Tags:**
- African Tribal Fusion: `World, African Drums (Djembe), Ethnic Choir Chants, Upbeat, Hypnotic, Hand Percussion, Call-and-Response`
- Celtic Folk: `Celtic, Irish Folk, Fiddle, Tin Whistle, Bodhrán Drum, Acoustic Guitar, Lively, Pastoral Atmosphere`
- Asian Meditation: `World, Chinese Traditional, Guzheng (Zither), Erhu (Fiddle), Ambient Drone, Slow, Meditative, Spiritual`

**Lyric Structure:**
```
[Intro | Atmosphere and Drone]
[Section A | Main Theme]
(primary melody with lead instrument)
[Section B | Development]
(add percussion or new instrument)
[Section A | Theme Reprise]
(main theme with variation)
[Bridge | Solo Improvisation]
(short solo or breakdown)
[Section A | Finale]
(final play of main theme)
[Outro | Ambient Fade]
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Scales and Modes:** Use `[Dorian Mode]`, `[Phrygian Mode]` for exotic tonalities. Mention `Pentatonic melody` for East Asian and Celtic. Use key tags like `[G Minor]` or `[C Major]`.

**Layering:** Start with drone or rhythm, layer melody later. Tag with `[Drone]` or `Monophonic` for single melody, `[Polyphonic]` for interwoven textures.

**Dynamic Transitions:** Use `[Crescendo]` for swelling drum circles. Use `[Call and Response]` between lead vocal and chorus.

**Ambient Sounds:** Add `[Rain]`, `[Wind]`, or `[Nature Ambience]` for scene-setting.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 20–30% for authentic traditional; 50–70% for fusion |
| Style Influence | 80%+ to enforce specific cultural elements |
| Exclude | `Electric, Synth, Drum Machine, Pop, Rock` for pure traditional |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Cultural Mixing:** Pick one region or cohesive fusion concept rather than mixing instruments from everywhere.
- **Lack of Familiarity:** The model may approximate complex rhythms or microtonal scales.
- **Repetitiveness:** Add progression tags or subtle evolution.
- **Language Barrier:** Tag with regional vocals (e.g., `Arabic Vocals`) for phonetic style.

---

### 9.8 Christian / Gospel

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** Gospel centers on powerful vocals and rich harmonies. Traditional gospel features piano or Hammond organ, choir vocals, drums and bass (often with swing or shuffle), electric guitar, clapping and foot stomping. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) uses acoustic guitar, drums, bass, keyboards, synth pads.

**Structure & Vocals:** Gospel uses verse-chorus structure with chorus repeated many times, often modulating up for emotional lift. Vocals are powerful, soulful, emotive with melisma and ad-libs. Harmonies are rich (3-part to full SATB).

**Mood:** Gospel is uplifting, joyous, spiritual. Even prayerful lyrics carry hope. Worship songs have reverent, warm mood building to passionate praise.

#### Example Tags & Structure

**Style Tags:**
- Traditional Gospel Choir: `Gospel, Church Choir, Organ, Piano, Handclaps, Uplifting, Powerful Female Lead Vocal, Soulful`
- Contemporary Worship (CCM): `Christian Pop, Acoustic Guitar, Warm Piano, Male Lead Vocal, Soaring Chorus, Inspirational, Praise & Worship`
- Gospel Funk Fusion: `Gospel, Funky Groove, Electric Bass Slap, Hammond Organ, Choir Harmonies, Upbeat, Soulful, Celebratory`

**Lyric Structure:**
```
[Intro | Instrumental + Choir Hum]
(band plays, choir humming softly)
[Verse 1 | Lead Solo]
(lead sings verse, minimal choir)
[Chorus | Full Choir Refrain]
(choir and lead together)
[Verse 2 | Testimony Verse]
(lead sings, choir answers)
[Chorus | Full Choir]
(repeat, bigger arrangement)
[Bridge | Modulate Up]
(key change, building intensity)
[Chorus | Finale + Ad-libs]
(final chorus, lead ad-libs over choir)
[Outro | Big Finish]
(sustained big chord)
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Call-and-Response & Harmonies:** Use `[Call and Response]` for lead/choir interplay. Use `[Harmonies]` generously for chorus sections. Include `[Choir]` for group vocal timbre.

**Dynamic Build & Modulation:** Tag bridge with `[Building Energy]` or `[Higher]`. Use `[Crescendo]` for swelling. Each subsequent chorus can have increased intensity tags.

**Rhythm and Groove:** Use `[Swing Feel]` for classic gospel bounce, `[Straight Feel]` for modern worship. Specify tempo: `[Fast Tempo]` for praise, `[Slow Tempo]` for ballads.

**Soulful Ad-libs:** Use `[Melismatic]` for vocal runs. Add `Vibrato` for soulful sustains.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 20–40% for traditional gospel |
| Style Influence | 80–100% for pure gospel/Christian style |
| Exclude | `Heavy Distortion, EDM, Synth Pads` for traditional; `Explicit, Aggressive` always |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Not Emphasizing Choir:** Ensure `Choir` is in style and section tags.
- **Overdoing Modern Elements:** Emphasize traditional instruments or exclude `Pop beat` if needed.
- **Weak Climax:** Explicitly mark final chorus with increasing intensity.
- **Style Confusion:** Use `Gospel Choir` for traditional, `Christian Pop` or `Worship` for CCM.

### 9.9 Classical

#### Genre Overview

**Instruments & Production:** Classical music features the orchestra: strings (violins, violas, cellos, bass), woodwinds (flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons), brass (trumpets, horns, trombones, tuba), and percussion (timpani, cymbals). Production is natural and acoustic with concert hall reverb.

**Structure:** Classical follows forms like sonata form, ABA (ternary), theme and variations, or rondo. No "verse/chorus" – instead, themes, development, recapitulation, and coda.

**Mood:** Classical can be majestic and dramatic, light and playful, or somber and melancholic. Indicate era: Baroque (ornate, steady), Romantic (lush, emotional), Modern (dissonant, minimalist).

#### Example Tags & Structure

**Style Tags:**
- Symphonic (Romantic): `Classical, Full Orchestra, Sweeping Strings, Majestic Brass, Dramatic, Dynamic Contrast, Rich Harmony`
- Chamber (Baroque): `Classical, String Quartet, Intimate, Elegant, Baroque Style, Harpsichord Continuo, Light Orchestration, Sophisticated`

**Lyric Structure:**
```
[Intro | Adagio]
(slow introduction)
[Theme A | Allegro]
(main theme, faster)
[Theme B | Contrasting]
(secondary theme)
[Development | Modulations]
(themes developed, varied)
[Recapitulation | Theme A]
(return of main theme)
[Coda | Finale]
(big ending conclusion)
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Orchestration Focus:** Use `Strings only` in one section, `Full Orchestra` in another. Use `[Counterpoint]` for multiple melodies, `[Unison]` for powerful statements, `[Canon]` or `[Fugue]` for imitative entries.

**Dynamics and Expression:** Use `[Piano]` and `[Forte]` for soft/loud sections. Use `[Crescendo]` and `[Diminuendo]` for swells. Specify articulation: `Legato Strings` or `Staccato`.

**Tempo Changes:** Use `Adagio`, `Allegro`, `[Slow Tempo]`, `[Fast Tempo]`. Add `Maestoso` for stately, broad passages.

**Harmonic Complexity:** Use `[Extended Chords]` for late Romantic, `[Dissonant Harmony]` for modern. Use `Diatonic, Simple Harmony` for Mozart-era.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 20–30% for conventional; 70% for avant-garde |
| Style Influence | 90–100% for pure classical |
| Exclude | `Drum Set, Electric, Synthesizer, Pop, Hip Hop`; `Vocals` for purely instrumental |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Sudden Non-Classical Elements:** Exclude and emphasize classical tags.
- **Too Cinematic/Modern:** Specify era: `18th century Classical style`, `Light Classical (Mozart-era)`.
- **Too Simple/Repetitive:** Use `Development`, `Variations` in structure. Provide distinct mood/instrumentation cues per section.
- **Choral Balance:** Add `Orchestral Balance` or reduce choir in some sections if needed.

(sax solo over changes)
[Solo 2 | Improv – Piano]
(piano solo)
[Head (Melody) Return]
(main theme returns)
[Outro | Tag Ending]
(ending riff or chord)
```

#### Advanced Tagging Techniques

**Harmony and Chord Tags:** Use `[Jazz Harmony]`, `[Extended Chords]`, `[Altered Chords]` for richness.

**Improvisation and Solos:** Use `[Improvisational]` or `Improvised solos`. Include `[Call and Response]` for trading fours or instrument interplay.

**Rhythm and Swing:** Use `[Swing Feel]` for swing, `[Straight Feel]` for Latin/fusion. Include `[Walking Bass]`, `Brushes on Drums`, `Ride Cymbal`. Use `[Latin Feel]` for Latin jazz.

**Arrangement Layers:** Indicate sparse intro with `[Intro | Bass + Drums only vamp]`. Add `[Shout Chorus]` for big band arrangements.

#### Production Tips

| Parameter | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Weirdness | 40–60% for traditional; higher for free jazz |
| Style Influence | 70–90% for jazz instrumentation and vibe |
| Exclude | `Electronic, Synth, Europop`; `Electric Guitar, Synth Bass` for acoustic jazz |

#### Common Mistakes

- **Not Swinging:** Include `Swing Feel` and appropriate tempo.
- **Harmony Too Simple/Weird:** Add `Jazz Harmony` tags or reduce weirdness.
- **Solos Overshadowing Structure:** Clearly label Head sections with instrument.
- **Style Confusion:** Specify subgenre or era. Add `1940s` for swing, `Fusion, Electric Guitar` for fusion.
- **Scat Vocals When Not Wanted:** Exclude `Vocals` or `Scatting` if unwanted.

## 10. Workflow, Tag Placement, and Troubleshooting

### 10.1 Recommended Workflow

1. Start with genre and mood
2. Add key instruments and vocal style
3. Define structure in the lyrics using `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]` tags
4. Add production and effects (reverb, delay, distortion, etc.)
5. Set advanced parameters (Weirdness, Style Influence, Exclude, Vocal Gender)
6. Generate, listen, adjust, and iterate

### 10.2 Tag Placement Strategy

**Lyrics field:**
- Structural tags: `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`
- Optional mood/energy tags per section (e.g. `[Chorus | High Energy | Anthemic]`)

**Style field:**
- Descriptive tags without brackets
- Priority: Genre → Mood → Lead instrument → Vocal style → Production → Atmosphere

**Target:**
- 3–5 core tags for simple songs
- 5–10 for detailed control
- 5–8 tags per section if tagging inside lyrics

### 10.3 Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet

**Problem: Too melodic or too soft**
- Add: `[Aggressive]`, `[Intense]`, `[High Energy]`, `[Distortion]`, `[Powerful Vocals]`
- Increase: Style Influence (closer to 70–90%)
- Decrease: Weirdness slightly if it keeps getting pretty instead of heavy
- Exclude: `Soft, Gentle, Acoustic, Ballad` if needed

**Problem: Too chaotic or unfocused**
- Reduce Weirdness to 20–40%
- Remove conflicting tags (e.g. `[Calm]` and `[Aggressive]` together)
- Simplify: One main genre, one dominant mood, 1–2 lead instruments

**Problem: Vocals not what you want**
- Set Vocal Gender: `Male` or `Female`
- Use Exclude: `Female Vocal` or `Male Vocal`
- Be explicit in style: `Spoken word, Rap, Screamed Vocals, Whispered Vocals`

**Problem: Too electronic**
- Exclude: `Electronic, Synth, Drum Machine, Electronic Drums`
- Add: `Acoustic Guitar, Acoustic Drums, Natural Reverb, Organic`

**Problem: Too acoustic**
- Exclude: `Acoustic Guitar, Acoustic Drums`
- Add: `Synthesizer, Electronic Drums, Drum Machine, Modern Production`

### 10.4 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too many tags:** Overloading confuses the model; keep it focused.
- **Contradictory tags:** Avoid simultaneous `[Calm]` and `[Aggressive]` unless you truly want complex contrast.
- **Vague descriptions:** Prefer specific instruments and qualities:
  - `Distorted Electric Guitar` > `Guitar`
  - `Smooth Soulful Female Vocals` > `Vocals`
- **Ignoring structure:** Always define at least `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]` in the lyrics.

## 11. Ultimate Success Formula and Pro Tips

### 11.1 Success Formula

Base pattern:
```
BASE GENRE + DOMINANT MOOD + LEAD INSTRUMENT + VOCAL STYLE +
ATMOSPHERE + PRODUCTION + STRUCTURE + PERSONAL TOUCH
= TARGET TRACK
```

Example:
```
Alternative Rock + Melancholic + Distorted Electric Guitar + Male Vocals +
Dark Atmosphere + Raw Production + Verse/Chorus/Bridge Structure +
Personal lyrical concept = Emotional rock anthem
```

### 11.2 Professional Formula (Parameters + Tags)

1. Define precise meta tags (aim for 15–20 if you want high control).
2. Set Style Influence high (70–80%) when you want fidelity.
3. Add Weirdness (40–60%) for creativity without losing structure.
4. Use Exclude Styles to remove unwanted genres, instruments, or vocal types.
5. Test: run 2–3 variations changing only Weirdness and Style Influence.

### 11.3 Genre-Specific Quick Reference

| Genre | Weirdness | Style Influence | Key Excludes |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| R&B/Hip-Hop | 30–50% | 70–90% | Opposite genre elements |
| Rock | 30–50% | 80–100% | Electronic, Hip Hop, Pop |
| Pop | 20–40% | 70–90% | Heavy Distortion, Screaming |
| Latin | 20–40% | 80–100% | Non-Latin elements |
| Country | 20–40% | 80–100% | Synthesizer, EDM, Hip Hop |
| Electronic/EDM | 40–60% | 80–90% | Acoustic, Organic |
| World | 20–30% | 80%+ | Electric, Synth, Modern |
| Gospel | 20–40% | 80–100% | EDM, Heavy Distortion |
| Classical | 20–30% | 90–100% | Drum Set, Electric, Synth |
| Jazz | 40–60% | 70–90% | Electronic, Synth |

### 11.4 Pro Tips

- **Less is more:** 3–5 tags per section is often better than 20.
- **Be specific:** `Electric Guitar Distortion` is more useful than `Guitar`.
- **Test variations:** Change one thing at a time (Weirdness, Style Influence, or a small tag group).
- **Study successes:** When a song comes out great, save its tags and parameters as a template.
- **Balance energy:** Use calmer tags in verses and more intense tags in choruses for a clear arc.
- **Contrast:** Intelligent contrast (soft vs heavy, electronic vs acoustic) makes tracks memorable.
- **Exclude opposites:** For faithful genre emulation, exclude opposite genres.
- **Structure matters:** Always define sections to avoid repetitive loops.
- **Priority ordering:** Put the most important tags first (genre, lead instrument).

## 12. AI Lyric Generation Style Guide

When using AI to generate lyrics, certain words, phrases, and rhyme patterns are overused to the point of becoming clichéd. This section provides guidance for avoiding "AI hot words" and a reusable prompt template for generating authentic, human-feeling lyrics.

### 12.1 Words and Phrases to Avoid or Use Sparingly

These elements appear so frequently in AI-generated lyrics that they signal inauthenticity. Avoid entirely or use only when genuinely earned by context.

#### Overused Nouns

- crown / throne / kingdom
- neon (especially "neon lights," "neon glow")
- halo / wings / angels
- ghost(s) — unless contextually earned
- chains / shackles
- ashes / embers / flames (the cliché trio)
- void / abyss
- maze / labyrinth
- armor / shield / sword
- scars — use very selectively
- canvas
- storm — massively overused
- ocean / waves / tide — use sparingly
- mirror — unless subverted
- demons
- echoes — overused as metaphor
- ruins
- silence — often lazy shorthand
- shadows — use sparingly, earn it
- frame — overused for memory/perspective metaphors

#### Cliché Phrases

- "ghost in the machine"
- "ashes to ashes"
- "rise from the ashes"
- "broken wings"
- "dance with the devil"
- "weight of the world"
- "heart of gold"

- "find the light"
- "walls come crashing down"
- "demons inside"
- "fire and ice"
- "bleeding heart"
- "pick up the pieces"
- "written in the stars"

- "edge of forever"
- "through the fire"
- "into the night"
- "paint the sky"
- "chasing dreams"
- "heart on my sleeve"
- "tear it all down"

#### Lazy Rhyme Pairs

These rhymes are so predictable they weaken the lyric:

- fire / desire
- heart / apart / start
- night / light / fight / sight
- pain / rain / vain / remain
- soul / whole / control
- time / mind / blind
- stay / away / day / say
- breath / death
- eyes / lies / skies / disguise
- burn / turn / learn
- fall / all / wall / call
- tears / fears / years
- dream / seem / stream
- road / load / showed
- ground / sound / found / around

#### Overused Verbs

- shatter / shattered
- drown / drowning
- burn / burning
- collide
- ignite
- unravel
- haunt — use sparingly
- crumble
- fade — watch frequency
- bleed (metaphorically)
- scream (into the void, etc.)
- crash
- soar

#### Adjective Crutches

- endless
- eternal
- hollow
- broken — massively overused
- shattered
- fading
- crimson / scarlet
- golden
- silent
- empty
- frozen
- savage
- relentless

### 12.2 Formatting Standards

- Use **hyphens (-)** for lyrical breaks and parenthetical thoughts, not em dashes (—)
  - Correct: "I lose you - then find you again"
  - Incorrect: "I lose you—then find you again"
- Use proper punctuation for breath and pacing
- Avoid excessive ellipses (...) — one per song maximum
- Let lines breathe; not every bar needs dense metaphor

### 12.3 What Makes Lyrics Feel Human

**Concrete sensory imagery** — "cold wind through an open door" beats "feeling so alone"

**Verbs of subtle motion** — linger, drift, shift, slip, pull, settle, press

**Temporal/spatial specificity** — "3 AM kitchen light" beats "the darkness of night"

**Earned complexity** — tension between competing emotions, not simple declarations

**Imperfect moments** — the small, unglamorous details that feel lived-in

**Subverted expectations** — set up a cliché, then pivot away from it

**Rhythmic variation** — mix line lengths, don't make every line symmetrical

### 12.6 Post-Generation Checklist

After AI generates lyrics, review against this checklist:

- [ ] No words from the "avoid" noun list used lazily
- [ ] No cliché phrases from the banned list
- [ ] No more than one lazy rhyme pair (ideally zero)
- [ ] At least 3 concrete sensory images
- [ ] At least 1 specific, unglamorous detail
- [ ] Hyphens used correctly (not em dashes)
- [ ] Line lengths vary naturally
- [ ] Emotional arc progresses — end differs from beginning
- [ ] Could a human have written this? Does it feel lived-in?

If the generated lyrics fail multiple items, regenerate with more specific constraints or edit manually.
